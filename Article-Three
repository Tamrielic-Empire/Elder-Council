III. The Rights of The Elder Council

- Councilors share the same rights as citizens but not the same rights as nobility.

- The position of High Chancellor is to be elected once every month.

- Only a Councilor may run for High Chancellor.

- During the prolonged absence of an Emperor or his hand, the High Chancellor controls the Empire. [A prolonged absence is at least 48 hours of total absence of an Emperor or Hand.]

- The Elder Council may raise one Legion of 20,000 men in a time of crisis, however, it must be voted on by the Council.

- The Elder Council can have an Emperor taken off the throne but it must be unanymous and with good, just reason. The Emperor may refuse to be dethroned if he believes there has been treachery. The Elder Council may not simply remove an Emperor for political reasons but for reasons of tyranny, insanity, or lack of capability. [The first of these means the Emperor has done something tyrannical, which is self explanatory, the second one means the Emperor does not know enough about Tamriel to run the group, meaning he thought Tamriel was a fast food resteraunt selling Big Macs, and the third one means they are never online enough. In any case, the group owner should be consulted before any decision is made.]

- A councilor may hold an emergency council meeting in case of a disaster, however each Councilor may only have one emergency meeting privelage each two month period.
